Two approaches to automatic music generation

## Approach 1 - Matlab

A bunch of scripts for generating melody based on given parameters:
 - melody ambitus
 - key
 - what intervals may occur (and probability of each interval - optional)

## Approach 2 - Python

My first attemp to incorporate neural networks, based on tutorials (sources given below).
Implementation of LSTM network that is supposed to generate music similar to the file given.
Working, but requires numerous corrections, especially in terms of network design.
